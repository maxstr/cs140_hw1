The source for this question is in the code zip as omp5.1.cpp.

This macro simply tells us whether OPENMP is available to the compiler.

5.2

We show issues starting around 100 threads and 10k trapezoids.

Source for this question is in code zip as omp5.3.c

c) With a single thread, we get a time of 0.001348. (trap_2 0.001290)

d) With two threads, we get a time of 0.002703 (trap_2 0.001324)

When using the block from the book in the modified code, we can only run a single Trap function at a time due to the addition being in a critical block. As such, it is essentially running serially even with two threads. For an execution such as this, the spawning of a new thread ends up slowing down the execution, which is why it is almost 2x slower with 2 threads. When we use Trap2, the trap function can execute in parallel so it is faster with two threads than with one.
